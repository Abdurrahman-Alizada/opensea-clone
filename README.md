# History of Development

## Day 01

#### Project setup
On first day I Setup the project by doing following activities :

1. Made the Next.js Project
2. Infura setup
    - Project creation
    - Installation of packages
    - Link the Infura project with my local Next.js Project
    - Hard Hat configuration

## Day 02

#### Understanding the architecture of OpenZeppelin

I explored the overall contract architecture of OpenZeppelin.

## Day 03

#### Starting the development of Smart Contract in Solidity with OpenZeppelin

1. Create 2 contract NFT and NFTMarket 


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
